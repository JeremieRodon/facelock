//! `preview --json`: one JSON document per frame, on stdout, until Ctrl+C.
//!
//! **stdout here is the frame stream and nothing else.** `--json` is parsed one
//! level up, so neither loop below knows whether a human or `jq` is reading,
//! and both must keep stdout clean either way. The regression this rule exists
//! for shipped: the no-enrollment notice went through `Terminal::info`, which
//! writes to stdout, so a fresh oneshot install prefixed the stream with a
//! localized sentence and a consumer failed on the first line.
//!
//! Two checks enforce it, one per way in. `#![deny(clippy::print_stdout)]`
//! below refuses a bare `println!` — CI runs clippy with `-D warnings` — while
//! leaving the frame loops' `writeln!` alone. The seam's stdout sinks are
//! invisible to that lint, so `no_stdout_sink_of_the_seam_is_used_here`
//! scans this file for them; [`warn`] is the convenience that makes the right
//! thing the short thing, not a barrier, since a fully-qualified call to
//! `crate::message::Terminal`'s informational sink needs no import to compile
//! here.
//!
//! The frame stream is the one payload in the CLI that does not go through
//! `message::payload`: it runs until interrupted, so a `--quiet` that silenced
//! it would leave a command that produces nothing forever.
