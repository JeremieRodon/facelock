//! Conformance test for gap E3: pin the exact D-Bus wire signature of every
//! type crossing the bus, plus the bus name/path/interface constants.
//!
//! D-Bus is the *only* auth path for user-run lockers (hyprlock, swaylock —
//! they cannot read the `0600 root:root` key, see gap-register.md DEC-2), so
//! an accidental wire-format change during the upgrade window (old client,
//! new daemon or vice versa) is a face-auth outage, not just a test failure.
//! The previous version of this file asserted `!sig.is_empty()`, which
//! cannot fail for any struct — it caught zero regressions. Every assertion
//! below is an exact string: if a field is added, removed, reordered, or
//! retyped on any of these structs, this file must be touched deliberately.
